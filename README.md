## Fetch receipts from Goodlife

Goodlife doesn't send receipts automatically (possibly illegal?). The company I work for provides a yearly wellness bonus so I need my receipts to submit for reimbursement. I have better things to do than try to remember to go fill out this long form on their site every two weeks. So I made this.

They don't provide access to receipts until 7 days after the charge, so note the `startDate` and `endDate` parameters.
